		<center>The asteroid's impact caused an immediate influx of thermal radiation that instantly burned everything within a 1500km radius. Although it slowly spread over further distances, the impact had an even greater impact on the tectonic plates. Despite landing near Mexico, the tectonic plates around the world were affected and thus actively caused earthquakes all over and under-water volcanoes formed quickly too. The deccan traps, found in a region now known as India, were a site of volcanic action that were active prior to the impact of the asteroid but due to the sudden activity of the plates, it caused the eruption in this region to happen more and faster. While Earthquakes and on-land Volcanic action made circumstances fatal for life forms on land, under-water volcanic action took part in the extinction of many water bound creatures. The layer of rock, known as the KT boundary, that stretched over the world was directly hit by the asteroid. Increased quantities of Iridium found in the layer quickly mixed with debris of the now shattered asteroid and caused chained catastrophic events that caused further loss of life and decelerated recovery of the planet.</center>

		The end of the age of the dinosaurs brought about change not only in the ecosystem but the entire world and it progressed to the state in which we live and know today. This article delves into why the Chicxulub impact event was such a huge moment in the entire history of the Earth and what the effects of such an enormous catastrophe on the world meant for both life and the structure of the planet.

		Before the asteroid crashed into the Earth, there weren’t unusual occurrences. It was only when the asteroid hit the earth, mere seconds after entering the atmosphere, was when the implications started to affect the world. The impact itself hit with the power of “billions of nuclear weapons” and was felt within the 1500km radius of impact immediately as it quickly spread further (Kurzgesagt, 2021). The immense amount of thermal radiation could be attributed to the fact that the asteroid hit at a point in the ocean that was shallow thus not cushioning the impact as much as it could have been elsewhere in the deep ocean instead. Although many scientists equate the eventualities that proceed to have a greater effect on the ecosystem and life on the planet, we can argue that the effect of the initial thermal radiation, released upon impact, was a great catalyst for what was still to occur considering even relatively small perturbations to the system could potentially have a catastrophic impact due to high climate sensitivity (Chiarenza et al., 2020). However, the thermal radiation wasn’t the only dire consequence of the impact. Nearby coasts would be hit by tsunamis of around 1km in height, which would decimate the surroundings however this isn't a fact considering past deposits of tsunamis are too unreliable to believe; it’s more like an assumption scientists believe considering it all adds up when you equate more surrounding damage with the fact that the asteroid didn’t crash into land (Alvarez et al., 1980).

    	<p class="ex2">
			The KT boundary is argued to be one of the main factors playing a key role in the extinction of most creatures on Earth when the impact happened. The KT boundary is a gigantic layer in the earth, consisting of clay with a high concentration of Iridium (lpi.usra.edu, 2020). The destruction of the KT boundary is touted to be the greatest reason for the extinction and shake-up of the planet due to the fact it caused countless environmental effects “such as extended darkness, global cooling, and acid rain”. The impact was so powerful that a combination of the iridium found throughout the KT layer around the world and the debris of the asteroid, which had broken up after crashing into the Earth, swallowed it whole and distributed the materials all over (Schulte, P. et al., 2010), causing a darkness period that scientists believe could have lasted up to 2 years (Andrei Ionescu, 2023). Kring (2007) discusses how spherules, a type of deposit that’s found in the asteroid, were similar in both the site of the impact and in Haiti where the KT boundary was studied. This backs up the claim that the debris of the impact and the destruction of the KT boundary was indeed mixed (with very little uncertainty), proving the point that the initial impact “occurred precisely at the KT boundary”.

		Global cooling also made it impossible for many life forms to survive due to the inability to adapt to unforeseen conditions and the state of the environment (not being able to photo-synthesize). Sanderson (2023) emphasized how much dust played a role in making the environment colder through the discovery of silicate particles being much more prevalent in samples of rocks formed during the Chicxulub impact event. After modeling the samples found, it was suggested that the dust stayed in the year for up to 15 years; a time that would have killed off many living creatures and plants alike. <br>Not only did the Asteroid impact affect the KT boundary but it also affected marine life and under-water volcanoes. The Deccan traps, as mentioned by both Loria (2018) and Kurzgesagt (2021), became particularly active (the Wai subgroup, becoming another topic of discussion on whether it was the main reason for the extinction of life. On top of that, the disturbance the impact caused the tectonic plates meant underwater volcanoes formed and just like the Deccan traps, would emit tonnes of lava and be named one of Earth’s “largest eruptive events” in history. Studies show that the Deccan traps were erupting well before the asteroid came into contact with the Earth however the impact only would’ve have triggered the volcanoes to erupt much quicker considering a constant eruption before the impact event did not affect life on the planet even slightly compared to the aftermath of the asteroid.

    <p class="ex2">
		<center>The impact of the asteroid as we’ve learned had two separate stages of immediate catastrophe and the following decades of intense events that slowly killed of most of the life and plant forms. The destruction of the KT Boundary can be attributed to being one of the main causes of eventual doom for any life form, through the spread of Iridium during the years of dust and it causing events such as Acid rain. Although the initial thermal radiation that was released on impact did not affect the rest of the world as much as it did compared to a radius of 1500km from impact, the effect the asteroid had on tectonic plates reverberated over the entire planet.</center>
