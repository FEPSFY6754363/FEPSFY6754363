    <p class="ex1">
        Debris from the impact of the Chicxulub Asteroid made the conditions of most living creatures impossible. Showers of said debris continuously rained down almost instantaneously after the impact, all ablaze and rapidly increased the heat of the overall planet. These circumstances were impossible for bigger reptiles (like the dinosaurs) and unconventionally large mammals to survive and was understood that 75% of all living species were wiped out due to the event (Pennisi, 2019).

    <p class="ex1">
        The Chicxulub asteroid, that collided with the Earth just over 66 million years ago, had a massive part in shaping how our planet exists today. It purged many lifeforms, such as the dinosaurs and other larger creatures, leaving behind birds and smaller reptiles. But how did this happen? The article delves into what direct effect the asteroid had and the planetary reactions that led us out of one era into another. The nature of the article is to explore how the Earth quickly underwent massive changes due to the scale of the impact and how it still affects us today.

    <p class="ex1">
        The Asteroid hit the earth with a blast of 100 million megatons (lpi.usra.edu, 2020). That’s 2 million times stronger than the strongest man-made nuclear weapon; the Tsar Bomb. The asteroid measured 10km and radiated a shock of radius 1500km, burst the surrounding area of the impact, launching debris totalling to more than the asteroid’s own mass into the planet’s atmosphere. Materials that were flung into space would either drift away although some would crash into the moon and other closer planets nearby. Debris from the impact, that stayed in the atmosphere, would continue to orbit the Earth for years and perpetually rain down, at high speed and temperatures. This happened upon impact between the asteroid and earth which quickly sent said Debris flying down on every part of the world, considering the debris would also orbit the planet upon launch. The culmination of incredibly hot debris falling from the sky quickly rose the temperature of the ground and air on earth, which scientists argue was either 100s of degrees Celsius for a few minutes or over a thousand degrees for around a minute (Kurzgesagt, 2021)
